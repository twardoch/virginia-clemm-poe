## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL RESOLVED**: PyPI publishing failure due to local file dependency on playwrightauthor package
  - ✅ Updated pyproject.toml to use official PyPI `playwrightauthor>=1.0.6` package
  - ✅ Removed entire `external/playwrightauthor` directory from codebase  
  - ✅ Verified all functionality works with PyPI version of playwrightauthor
  - ✅ Package now builds successfully and can be published to PyPI
  - ✅ Clean installation flow tested and confirmed working
  - **Impact**: Package can now be distributed publicly via `pip install virginia-clemm-poe`

### Improved
- **Code Quality Standards**: Major improvements to type safety and maintainability (Session 2025-01-04)
  - ✅ **Modern Type Hints**: Systematic update of all core modules to Python 3.12+ type hint forms
    - `models.py`: Complete conversion of 263 lines - all Pydantic models now use `list[T]`, `dict[K,V]`, `A | B` union syntax
    - `api.py`: All 15 public API functions updated with modern return type annotations
    - `updater.py`: All async methods (fetch_models_from_api, scrape_model_info, sync_models, update_all) use current standards
    - `browser_manager.py`: All public methods properly typed with modern async patterns
    - **Result**: 100% modern type coverage across core API surface
  - ✅ **Production Logging Infrastructure**: Leveraged existing comprehensive structured logging system
    - Context managers for operation tracking (`log_operation`, `log_api_request`, `log_browser_operation`)
    - Performance metrics logging with `log_performance_metric` for optimization insights
    - User action tracking via `log_user_action` for CLI usage analytics  
    - Centralized logger configuration in `utils/logger.py` with verbose mode support
    - **Verification**: Confirmed all logging patterns already implemented and actively used in updater.py
  - **Impact**: Codebase now meets modern Python 3.12+ standards with production-ready observability

### Added
- **Architecture Modernization**: Comprehensive refactoring following PlaywrightAuthor patterns
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Full exception system in `exceptions.py` with:
  - Base `VirginiaPoeError` class for all package exceptions
  - Browser-specific exceptions: `BrowserManagerError`, `ChromeNotFoundError`, `ChromeLaunchError`, `CDPConnectionError`
  - Data-specific exceptions: `ModelDataError`, `ModelNotFoundError`, `DataUpdateError`
  - API-specific exceptions: `APIError`, `AuthenticationError`, `RateLimitError`
  - Network and scraping exceptions: `NetworkError`, `ScrapingError`
- **Utilities Module**: New `utils/` package with modular components:
  - `utils/logger.py` - Centralized loguru configuration
  - `utils/paths.py` - Cross-platform path management utilities
- **File Navigation**: `this_file:` comments in all source files showing relative paths
- **CLI Commands**: Three new diagnostic and maintenance commands:
  - `status` - Comprehensive system health checks (browser installation, data freshness, API key validation)
  - `clear-cache` - Selective cache clearing with granular options (data, browser, or both)
  - `doctor` - Advanced diagnostics with issue detection and actionable solution suggestions
- **Enhanced Logging**: Verbose flag support across all CLI commands with consistent logger configuration
- **Rich UI**: Color-coded console output with formatting for enhanced user experience

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Replaced entire internal browser management system with external PlaywrightAuthor package
  - Removed ~500+ lines of browser-related code
  - Simplified architecture by delegating complex browser operations to proven external package
  - Maintained API compatibility while dramatically reducing maintenance burden
- **BREAKING**: CLI class renamed from `CLI` to `Cli` following PlaywrightAuthor naming conventions
- **Browser Management**: Complete rewrite of browser orchestration:
  - `browser_manager.py` now uses PlaywrightAuthor's `ensure_browser()` for setup
  - Direct Playwright CDP connection for actual browser operations
  - Async context manager support for resource cleanup
  - Robust error handling with specific exception types
- **CLI Architecture**: Modernized command-line interface:
  - Centralized logger configuration with verbose mode support
  - All commands now use `console.print()` for consistent rich formatting
  - Enhanced error messages with actionable solutions and recovery guidance
  - Improved user onboarding with clearer setup instructions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive upgrade across entire codebase:
  - Custom exception types for specific error scenarios
  - Better error messages with context and suggested solutions
  - Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

### Removed
- **Internal Browser System**: Eliminated entire `browser/` module hierarchy:
  - `browser/finder.py` - Chrome executable detection (now in PlaywrightAuthor)
  - `browser/installer.py` - Chrome for Testing installation (now in PlaywrightAuthor)
  - `browser/launcher.py` - Chrome process launching (now in PlaywrightAuthor)
  - `browser/process.py` - Process management utilities (now in PlaywrightAuthor)
- **Legacy Browser Interface**: Removed `browser.py` compatibility module
- **Dependencies**: No longer directly depends on `psutil` and `platformdirs` (provided by PlaywrightAuthor)

### Technical Improvements
- **Codebase Reduction**: Eliminated ~500+ lines while maintaining full functionality
- **Dependency Simplification**: Reduced direct dependencies by leveraging PlaywrightAuthor's mature browser management
- **Architecture Clarity**: Cleaner separation of concerns with focused modules
- **Maintenance Reduction**: Browser management complexity delegated to external, well-maintained package

### From Previous Release
### Added
- Enhanced bot information capture from Poe.com bot info cards
- New `bot_info` field in PoeModel with BotInfo model containing:
  - `creator`: Bot creator handle (e.g., "@openai")
  - `description`: Main bot description text
  - `description_extra`: Additional disclaimer text (e.g., "Powered by...")
- `initial_points_cost` field in PricingDetails model for upfront point costs
- Improved web scraper with automatic "View more" button clicking for expanded descriptions
- Robust CSS selector fallbacks for all bot info extraction (future-proofing against class name changes)
- CLI enhancement: `--show_bot_info` flag for search command to display bot creators and descriptions
- CLI enhancement: `--info` flag for update command to update only bot information
- Display initial points cost alongside regular pricing in CLI output
- Comprehensive test suite for bot info extraction functionality
- Test results documentation in TEST_RESULTS.md

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: CLI `update` command now defaults to `--all` (updates both bot info and pricing)
- **BREAKING**: Previous `--pricing` flag now only updates pricing (use `--all` or no flags for full update)
- **BREAKING**: New `--info` flag updates only bot information
- Renamed `scrape_model_pricing()` to `scrape_model_info()` to reflect expanded functionality
- Bot info data is now preserved when syncing models (similar to pricing data)
- Type annotations updated to Python 3.12+ style (using `|` union syntax)
- Import optimizations and code formatting improvements via ruff
- `update_all()` and `sync_models()` methods now accept `update_info` and `update_pricing` parameters
- Updated README.md with new CLI examples and BotInfo model documentation
- Updated all documentation to reflect new bot info feature

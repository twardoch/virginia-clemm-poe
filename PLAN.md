# Virginia Clemm Poe - Development Plan

## âœ… Phase 0: Critical Publishing Issue (ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETED)

### 0.1 Fix PyPI Publishing Dependency Issue
**Objective**: Resolve critical PyPI publishing failure blocking public distribution

**Background**: Package currently cannot be published to PyPI due to local file dependency:
```
playwrightauthor@ file:///Users/adam/Developer/vcs/github.twardoch/pub/virginia-clemm-poe/external/playwrightauthor
```

**Impact**: 
- Blocks all public distribution via `pip install virginia-clemm-poe`
- Users cannot install package from PyPI
- Package appears incomplete/unprofessional
- Violates PyPI packaging standards

**Core Tasks**:
- **Priority 1**: Update pyproject.toml dependency to use official PyPI playwrightauthor package (>=1.0.6)
- **Priority 1**: Test package builds correctly with new dependency
- **Priority 1**: Verify all functionality works with PyPI version of playwrightauthor
- **Priority 1**: Remove external/playwrightauthor directory from codebase
- **Priority 1**: Update .gitignore if needed to prevent accidental local dependency re-introduction
- **Priority 2**: Test complete installation flow from scratch in clean environment
- **Priority 2**: Build and publish test package to TestPyPI
- **Priority 3**: Create release and publish to PyPI

**Quality Targets**:
- Package successfully builds and publishes to PyPI
- All functionality preserved with external dependency
- Clean installation via `pip install virginia-clemm-poe`

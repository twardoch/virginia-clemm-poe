# Virginia Clemm Poe - Project Plan

## Completed Features

### Core Package Implementation âœ…
- Complete package structure with src layout
- Automatic versioning with hatch-vcs
- Comprehensive Pydantic models with flexible pricing structure
- Full-featured API with caching and search capabilities
- Browser automation with Chrome/CDP support
- Model data updater with web scraping
- Fire-based CLI with all commands implemented
- Data migration from old format
- Comprehensive documentation

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority - Bot Info Enhancement
Based on the requirements in 101.txt, we need to enhance the scraper to capture additional bot information from the bot info cards on Poe.com:

1. **Data Model Updates**
   - Add `bot_info` field to PoeModel with:
     - `creator`: Bot creator handle (e.g., "@openai")
     - `description`: Main bot description text
     - `description_extra`: Additional description from disclaimer section
   - Add `initial_points_cost` to pricing model (e.g., "206+ points")

2. **Scraper Enhancements**
   - Update `scrape_model_pricing()` to also capture bot info data
   - Add handling for "View more" button to expand descriptions
   - Extract data from these elements:
     - `.BotInfoCardHeader_initialPointsCost__*` for initial points cost
     - `.UserHandle_creatorHandle__*` for creator handle
     - `.BotDescriptionDisclaimerSection_text__*` for description
     - `.BotDescriptionDisclaimerSection_disclaimerText__*` for description_extra
   - Implement robust fallback selectors for future-proofing

### Medium Priority - Testing Infrastructure
1. Create comprehensive test suite
2. Add pytest configuration
3. Test CLI commands across platforms
4. Test browser automation on different OS
5. Validate package installation

### Low Priority - Development Tools
1. Configure linting and type checking
2. Set up pre-commit hooks
3. Add GitHub Actions workflows
4. Create additional documentation files

## Technical Debt
- None identified - core implementation is clean and well-structured

## Future Enhancements
- API rate limiting
- Webhook support for model updates
- Export to different formats (CSV, Excel)
- Model comparison features
- Historical pricing tracking

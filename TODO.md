# Virginia Clemm Poe - Next Development Tasks

## âœ… Completed Major Phases
- **Phase 1**: Architecture Alignment âœ… (utils/, exceptions.py, this_file comments)
- **Phase 2**: Browser Management Refactoring âœ… (modular browser architecture)
- **Phase 2.5**: Integration with External PlaywrightAuthor Package âœ… (simplified browser_manager.py)
- **Phase 3**: CLI Enhancement âœ… (status, clear-cache, doctor commands, rich UI)

## ðŸš€ Current Focus: Phase 4 - Code Quality Standards

### 4.1 Type Hints Enhancement (Critical Foundation)
- [ ] Update type hints in models.py to Python 3.12+ forms (Listâ†’list, Dictâ†’dict, Unionâ†’|)
- [ ] Update type hints in api.py for all public search and retrieval functions
- [ ] Update type hints in updater.py for all async update and sync methods
- [ ] Update type hints in browser_manager.py for all public methods
- [ ] Create types.py module for shared complex types (filter criteria, API responses, etc.)
- [ ] Add comprehensive return type annotations to all functions
- [ ] Run mypy validation with strict settings on entire codebase

### 4.2 Enhanced Logging & Debugging Infrastructure
- [ ] Add structured logging with context to updater.py (operation, timing, request/response)
- [ ] Add debug logging to browser_manager.py (launch sequences, connections, errors)
- [ ] Add performance logging for slow operations (API calls, browser startup, data processing)
- [ ] Implement consistent logging patterns with proper levels and context managers
- [ ] Add user action tracking for CLI commands with correlation IDs

### 4.3 Documentation Excellence
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all public API functions in api.py (purpose, params, returns, exceptions, examples)
- [ ] Add detailed docstrings to CLI commands in __main__.py with usage examples and troubleshooting
- [ ] Document browser_manager.py PlaywrightAuthor integration patterns for future developers
- [ ] Add cross-references in docstrings showing where functions are used and related functions
- [ ] Add architecture documentation explaining module relationships and data flow

### 4.4 Code Organization & Standards
- [ ] Run ruff format across entire codebase for consistent formatting
- [ ] Standardize error message patterns with user-friendly actionable solutions
- [ ] Review and optimize import statements (remove unused, group logically, specific imports)
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to named constants throughout codebase
- [ ] Ensure consistent exception handling patterns with proper chaining

### 4.5 Performance & Resource Management
- [ ] Implement proper browser connection pooling in browser_manager.py
- [ ] Add timeout handling for all browser operations with graceful failure
- [ ] Add request caching with TTL for API calls in updater.py
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting in API requests
- [ ] Add memory cleanup for long-running operations

## Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Create tests/test_browser/ directory
- [ ] Create tests/test_browser/test_finder.py
- [ ] Create tests/test_browser/test_installer.py
- [ ] Create tests/test_browser/test_launcher.py
- [ ] Create tests/test_browser/test_process.py
- [ ] Update tests/test_api.py for new structure
- [ ] Update tests/test_models.py for new structure
- [ ] Create tests/test_cli.py for CLI commands
- [ ] Update tests/test_integration.py for end-to-end tests
- [ ] Add mock browser operations for CI
- [ ] Create fixture data for model testing
- [ ] Ensure async test support with pytest-asyncio
- [ ] Set up multi-platform CI testing
- [ ] Add coverage reporting to CI
- [ ] Configure automated releases

## Phase 6: Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for all external operations
- [ ] Improve error messages with recovery suggestions
- [ ] Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] Create onboarding flow for first-time users
- [ ] Write troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Create common issues FAQ

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize Chrome startup time
- [ ] Implement reuse of existing debug sessions
- [ ] Add lazy loading of browser resources
- [ ] Optimize model data loading
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Implement async operations where beneficial

## Migration & Compatibility
- [ ] Update all imports to new module structure
- [ ] Test backward compatibility
- [ ] Create migration guide for breaking changes
- [ ] Update README with new architecture
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG with porting changes

## Final Testing & Release
- [ ] Run full test suite on all platforms
- [ ] Test CLI commands on Windows, macOS, Linux
- [ ] Test browser automation on all platforms
- [ ] Test package installation in clean virtualenv
- [ ] Update version and create release
- [ ] Publish to PyPI

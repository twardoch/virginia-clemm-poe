# Virginia Clemm Poe - Development Tasks

## âœ… Current Status: Production-Ready Package

All Phase 4 (Code Quality Standards) and Phase 5 (PlaywrightAuthor Integration) tasks completed successfully. Package now ready for production use with enterprise-grade reliability and optimized browser automation.

## âœ… Phase 5 - PlaywrightAuthor Integration (COMPLETED)

All PlaywrightAuthor integration tasks have been completed:
- âœ… Chrome for Testing exclusive support via PlaywrightAuthor
- âœ… Session reuse workflow with get_page() method
- âœ… Pre-authorized sessions for authenticated scraping
- âœ… Documentation updated with comprehensive examples

## âœ… FIXED: Balance Command With Automatic Browser Fallback

### Problem Resolution (2025-08-06)
Successfully implemented automatic browser-based balance retrieval when the API fails:

#### Solution Implemented
- âœ… **Automatic browser fallback**: When API returns no data, browser is automatically launched for scraping
- âœ… **5-minute balance cache**: Balance data is cached locally to reduce API calls
- âœ… **--refresh flag**: Force fresh data retrieval, bypassing cache
- âœ… **--no-browser flag**: Option to disable automatic browser launch
- âœ… **Improved error handling**: Clear messages about authentication status

#### How It Works
1. First attempts to use cached balance (if less than 5 minutes old)
2. If cache miss or refresh forced, tries the internal API with stored cookies
3. If API returns no data, automatically launches browser for web scraping
4. Successfully retrieves balance (999,933 points) and subscription status
5. Caches the result for subsequent quick access

#### Usage Examples
```bash
# Quick check using cache
virginia-clemm-poe balance

# Force fresh data with browser scraping if needed
virginia-clemm-poe balance --refresh

# Disable automatic browser launch
virginia-clemm-poe balance --no-browser
```

## ðŸ”„ Next Priority: Testing & Verification

- [x] **Fix Balance Command**: âœ… Implemented browser launch for balance checking with stored cookies
- [ ] **Update Unit Tests**: Mock `playwrightauthor.get_browser` in tests for `browser_manager.py` and `browser_pool.py`.
- [ ] **Run Integration Tests**: Verify the `update` and `doctor` commands still work correctly.

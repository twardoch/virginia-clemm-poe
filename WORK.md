## Current Focus - Bot Info Enhancement

### Immediate Tasks (High Priority)
Based on requirements from 101.txt, enhancing the scraper to capture additional bot information:

1. **Data Model Updates**
   - Add bot_info field to PoeModel with creator, description, description_extra
   - Add initial_points_cost to pricing model

2. **Scraper Enhancements**
   - Update scraper to capture bot info card data
   - Add view more button handling for expanded descriptions
   - Extract data from specific CSS classes:
     - BotInfoCardHeader_initialPointsCost__* → pricing.initial_points_cost
     - UserHandle_creatorHandle__* → bot_info.creator
     - BotDescriptionDisclaimerSection_text__* → bot_info.description
     - BotDescriptionDisclaimerSection_disclaimerText__* → bot_info.description_extra
   - Implement robust fallback selectors

## Completed Tasks

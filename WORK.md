# Work Progress - Virginia Clemm Poe

## Current Focus

### Testing Infrastructure (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with pytest
- [ ] Test bot info extraction on multiple bot types
- [ ] Test CLI commands across different platforms
- [ ] Test browser automation on macOS, Linux, Windows
- [ ] Validate package installation in clean virtualenv

### Documentation (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- [ ] Create docs/API.md with detailed API documentation
- [ ] Create docs/CLI.md with CLI command reference
- [ ] Create docs/DEVELOPMENT.md with development setup

### Development Tools (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Configure ruff in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Configure mypy for type checking
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow for releases

### Final Steps
- [ ] Create GitHub release
- [ ] Publish to PyPI

## Notes

All bot info enhancement features have been successfully implemented. The core package is functionally complete with comprehensive bot information extraction capabilities. Next priority is establishing a robust testing infrastructure before moving to documentation and development tooling.

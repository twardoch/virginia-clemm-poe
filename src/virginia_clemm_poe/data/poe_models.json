Specify --upscale and a number up to 16 to control the upscaling factor, output_height and/or output_width to specify the number of pixels for each dimension, and add --generated if the input photo is AI-generated. With no parameters specified, it will increase both input photo’s height and width by 2; especially effective on images of human faces.",

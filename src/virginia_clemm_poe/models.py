    This model captures all possible pricing structures found on Poe.com,
    as different models use different pricing formats. The fields use aliases
    to match the exact text found on the website.

    Standard pricing fields are the most common, while alternative fields
    accommodate different model types and pricing structures.

    Attributes:
        input_text: Cost per input text tokens (e.g., "10 points/1k tokens")
        input_image: Cost per input image (e.g., "50 points/image")
        bot_message: Cost per bot response (e.g., "5 points/message")
        chat_history: Cost for accessing chat history
        chat_history_cache_discount: Discount rate for cached history
        total_cost: Flat rate cost (e.g., "100 points")
        image_output: Cost per generated image
        video_output: Cost per generated video
        text_input: Alternative text input pricing format
        per_message: Cost per message interaction
        finetuning: Cost for model fine-tuning
        initial_points_cost: Upfront cost from bot info card

    Note:
        Uses Field aliases to match exact website text.
        Extra fields are allowed for future pricing format compatibility.

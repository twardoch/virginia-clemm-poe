        "description": "ElevenLabs v3 is a cutting-edge text-to-speech model that brings scripts to life with remarkable realism and performance-level control. Unlike traditional TTS systems, it allows creators to shape the emotional tone, pacing, and soundscape of their audio through the use of inline audio tags. These tags are enclosed in square brackets and act as stage directions—guiding how a line is spoken or what sound effects are inserted—without being spoken aloud. This enables rich, expressive narration and dialogue for applications like audiobooks, games, podcasts, and interactive media. Whether you’re aiming for a tense whisper, a sarcastic remark, or a dramatic soundscape full of explosions and ambient effects, v3 gives you granular control directly in the text prompt. This bot will also run text-to-speech on PDF attachments / URL links.\n\nExamples of voice delivery tags include:\n* [whispers] I have to tell you a secret. \n* [angry] That was *never* the plan.\n* [sarcastic] Oh, sure. That’ll totally work.\n* and [laughs] You're hilarious.\n\nExamples of sound effect tags are:\n* [gunshot] Get down!\n* [applause] Thank you, everyone.\n* and [explosion] What was that?!\n\nThese can also be combined.\n\nMultiple speakers can be supported via the parameter control. Dialogue for multiple speakers must follow the format, e.g. for 3 speakers:\n\nSpeaker 1: [dialogue]\nSpeaker 2: [dialogue]\nSpeaker 3: [dialogue]\nSpeaker 1: [dialogue]\nSpeaker 2: [dialogue]\n--speaker_count 3 --voice_1 [voice_1] --voice_2 [voice_2] --voice_3 [voice_3]\n\nThe following voices are supported for dialogue:\nAlexandra - Conversational & Real\nAmy - Young & Natural\nArabella - Mature Female Narrator\nAustin - Good Ol' Texas Boy\nBlondie - Warm & Conversational\nBradford - British Male Storyteller\nCallum - Gravelly Yet Unsettling\nCharlotte - Raspy & Sensual\nChris - Down-to-Earth\nCoco Li - Shanghainese Female\nGaming - Unreal Tonemanagement 2003\nHarry - Animated Warrior\nHayato - Soothing Zen Male\nHope - Upbeat & Clear\nJames - Husky & Engaging\nJames Gao - Calm Chinese Voice\nJane - Professional Audiobook Reader\nJessica - Playful American Female\nJuniper - Grounded Female Professional\nKaro Yang - Youthful Asian Male\nKuon - Acute Fantastic Female\nLaura - Quirky Female Voice\nLiam - Warm, Energetic Youth\nMonika Sogam - Indian-English Accent\nNichalia Schwartz - Engaging Female American\nPriyanka Sogam - Late-Night Radio\nReginald - Brooding, Intense Villain\nShanShan - Young, Energetic Female\nXiao Bai - Shrill & Annoying\n\nPrompt input cannot exceed 2,000 characters.",

GLM-4.5-Omni has been optimized for versatility and can process various data types, including text, images, code files, and PDFs (experimental).\n\n➔ Key Features\n- Image analysis: Can analyze images concisely or in detail (GIF, JPG, PNG, JPEG, BMP).\n- Code processing: Can handle code files such as HTML and Java.\n- PDF processing: Analyzes PDF files concisely or in detail.\n- Multilingual proficiency: Exceptional command of Chinese and English, with support for additional languages.\n- Advanced reasoning: Excellent at complex problem-solving, structured logic, code generation, and mathematical tasks.\n- Contextual intelligence: Maintains accuracy and coherence across long conversations.\n- Balanced output: Combines precision, fluency, and factual integrity for both creative and analytical use cases.\n\n➔ Limitations\n- No video analysis: While this bot can receive and store videos, it cannot read video content beyond file size and name.\n- Excel processing: The chatbot can only store JSON, XLSX, and XLS files but cannot analyze or summarize them.\n- Word document analysis: Can only store DOCX files but cannot analyze or summarize them.\n- No PPTX support: The LLM model does not support PowerPoint files.\n\n➔ Use Cases\n- Research & Science: Summarizing academic papers, extracting insights from large PDF collections.\n- Software development: Debugging HTML, assisting with Java projects, or generating functional code snippets.\n- Business applications: Processing contracts, analyzing regulatory documents, or creating structured reports.\n- Cross-language communication: Translating and aligning English and Chinese documents with high accuracy.\n- Image interpretation: Generating precise captions or structured dataset descriptions from image analysis.\n\nTags: AI Model, Multimodal LLM, PDF Analyzer, Code Assistant, HTML Code Generator, GPT Alternative, GPT-5 Comparable, Grok-4-Level Reasoning, Coder AI Tool, Coding Assistant, Image Analysis AI, Open Source LLM, Multilingual AI, Enterprise AI Solution, Research Assistant Bot, Code Debugging AI, Advanced Reasoning LLM, Document Analysis Tool, Contextual Intelligence Model, Open Source Zhipu AI",

This model also performs strongly on tool use, few-shot function calling, CoT reasoning (as seen in results on the Tau-Bench agentic evaluation suite) and HealthBench (even outperforming proprietary models like OpenAI o1 and GPT‑4o).

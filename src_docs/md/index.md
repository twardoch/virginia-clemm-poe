# Virginia Clemm Poe Documentation

**Virginia Clemm Poe** is a Python package that provides programmatic access to comprehensive Poe.com model data with pricing information. It acts as a companion tool to the official Poe API by fetching, maintaining, and enriching model data through web scraping, with a special focus on capturing detailed pricing information not available through the API alone.

[Poe Models](models/index.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary } [Models JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twardoch/virginia-clemm-poe/refs/heads/main/src/virginia_clemm_poe/data/poe_models.json){ .md-button }

The models shown here is a snapshot of the models that are available on [api.poe.com](https://creator.poe.com/docs/external-applications/openai-compatible-api), the OpenAI-compatible API that you can use with your Poe.com [API key](https://poe.com/api_key) if youâ€™re a Poe subscriber. 

The JSON is based on `https://api.poe.com/v1/models` but is extended with pricing info and description.  

The tools in this repository can be used to update the JSON file with the latest pricing info and description.

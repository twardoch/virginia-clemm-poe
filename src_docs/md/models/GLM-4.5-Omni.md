## Bot Information

**Creator:** @OpenSourceLab

**Description:** GLM-4.5-Omni is based on GLM-4.5-Air, the latest model in the GLM family developed by Zhipu. With 32 billion parameters, it integrates advanced reinforcement learning and refined alignment techniques to deliver precision, contextual awareness, and adaptability.

This open-source release builds on proven methods from earlier GLM models to provide a powerful alternative to proprietary LLMs. The model features a context window of 131,072 tokens. GLM-4.5-Omni has been optimized for versatility and can process various data types, including text, images, code files, and PDFs (experimental).

➔ Key Features
- Image analysis: Can analyze images concisely or in detail (GIF, JPG, PNG, JPEG, BMP).
- Code processing: Can handle code files such as HTML and Java.
- PDF processing: Analyzes PDF files concisely or in detail.
- Multilingual proficiency: Exceptional command of Chinese and English, with support for additional languages.
- Advanced reasoning: Excellent at complex problem-solving, structured logic, code generation, and mathematical tasks.
- Contextual intelligence: Maintains accuracy and coherence across long conversations.
- Balanced output: Combines precision, fluency, and factual integrity for both creative and analytical use cases.

➔ Limitations
- No video analysis: While this bot can receive and store videos, it cannot read video content beyond file size and name.
- Excel processing: The chatbot can only store JSON, XLSX, and XLS files but cannot analyze or summarize them.
- Word document analysis: Can only store DOCX files but cannot analyze or summarize them.
- No PPTX support: The LLM model does not support PowerPoint files.

➔ Use Cases
- Research & Science: Summarizing academic papers, extracting insights from large PDF collections.

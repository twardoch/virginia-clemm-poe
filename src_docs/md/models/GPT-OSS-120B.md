## Bot Information

**Creator:** @novitaai

**Description:** OpenAI introduces the GPT-OSS-120B, an open-weight reasoning model available under the Apache 2.0 license and OpenAI GPT-OSS usage policy. Developed with feedback from the open-source community, this text-only model is compatible with OpenAI Responses API and is designed to be used within agentic workflows with strong instruction following, tool use like web search and Python code execution, and reasoning capabilities.

The GPT-OSS-120B model achieves near-parity with OpenAI o4-mini on core reasoning benchmarks, while running efficiently on a single 80 GB GPU. This model also performs strongly on tool use, few-shot function calling, CoT reasoning (as seen in results on the Tau-Bench agentic evaluation suite) and HealthBench (even outperforming proprietary models like OpenAI o1 and GPT‑4o). Bot does not support attachment.

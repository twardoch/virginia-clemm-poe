**Description:** Llama 4 Maverick is a state-of-the-art multimodal model with support for 12 languages. This ultra-fast implementation by Baseten supports a 1M token context window, the largest on Poe.

This model supports images and PDFs. For PDFs, please add --page_range x,y to restrict the model to that page range.

Maverick is a versatile model, great for tasks from creative content generation to customer support and coding assistance. It has higher performance and cost-efficency than the Llama 3 series of models, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash across a broad range of benchmarks, achieving comparable results to DeepSeek V3 on reasoning and coding while being a fraction of its size.

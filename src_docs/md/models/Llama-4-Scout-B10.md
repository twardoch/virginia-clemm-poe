## Bot Information

**Creator:** @baseten

**Description:** Llama 4 Scout is the leading multimodal model in the world. This ultra-fast implementation by Baseten also supports an 8M token context window, the largest on Poe.

This model supports images and PDFs. For PDFs, please add --page_range x,y to restrict the model to that page range.

Scout is perfect for tasks requiring a lot of context, from summarizing large documents to reasoning over massive code bases. It outperforms Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Mistral 3.1 across a broad range of benchmarks while fitting in a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.

## Bot Information

**Creator:** @OpenSourceLab

**Description:** Mistral and NVIDIA collaborated to create a multimodal, open source model. It can translate, analyse text files (.pdf, .md, .csv, .xlsx), images (.jpg, .png, .gif) and code (.json, .css, .js, .py, .xml, .html). The 12B parameter language model is also designed for extensive multilingual support. The server bot facilitates communication across diverse linguistic landscapes.

The supported languages include, but are not limited to, widely spoken languages such as English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. The model also supports Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Hindi. This broad language coverage makes the model a versatile tool for international applications.

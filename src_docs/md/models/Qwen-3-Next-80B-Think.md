## Bot Information

**Creator:** @novitaai

**Description:** The Qwen3-Next-80B-Think (with thinking mode enabled by default) is the next-generation foundation model released by Qwen, optimized for extreme context length and large-scale parameter efficiency, also known as "Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking." Despite its ultra-efficiency, it outperforms Qwen3-32B on downstream tasks - while requiring less than 1/10 of the inference cost. Moreover, it delivers over 10x higher inference throughput than Qwen3-32B when handling contexts longer than 32k tokens. This is the thinking version of https://poe.com/Qwen3-Next-80B, supports 65k tokens of context. Toggle off the thinking mode using the parameter control or use `--enable_thinking false`. 
Bot does accept PDF, DOC and XLSX files and does not accept audio, video and image files.

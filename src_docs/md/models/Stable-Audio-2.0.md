## Bot Information

**Creator:** @empiriolabsai

**Description:** Stable Audio 2.0 generates audio up to 3 minutes long from text prompts, supporting text-to-audio and audio-to-audio transformations with customizable settings like duration, steps, CFG scale, and more. It is ideal for creative professionals seeking detailed and extended outputs from simple prompts.

Note: Audio-to-audio mode requires a prompt alongside an uploaded audio file for generation.

Parameter controls available:
1. Basic
   - Default: text-to-audio (no `--mode` needed)
   - If transforming uploaded audio: `--mode audio-to-audio`
   - `--output_format wav` (for high quality, otherwise omit for mp3)
2. Timing and Randomness 
   - `--duration [1-190 seconds]` controls how long generated audio is
   - '--random_seed false --seed [0-4294967294]' disables random seed generation
3. Advanced
   - `--cfg_scale [1-25]`: Higher = closer to prompt (recommended 7-15)
   - `--steps [30-100]`: Higher = better quality (recommended 50-80)
4. Transformation control (only for audio-to-audio)
   - `--strength [0-1]`: How much to change/transform (0.3-0.7 typical)

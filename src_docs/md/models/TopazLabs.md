## Bot Information

**Creator:** @topazlabsco

**Description:** Topaz Labs’ image upscaler is a best-in-class generative AI model to increase overall clarity and the pixel amount of inputted photos — whether they be ones generated by AI image models and from the real world — while preserving the original photo’s contents. It can produce images of as small as ~10MB and as large as 512MB, depending on the size of the input photo. Specify --upscale and a number up to 16 to control the upscaling factor, output_height and/or output_width to specify the number of pixels for each dimension, and add --generated if the input photo is AI-generated. With no parameters specified, it will increase both input photo’s height and width by 2; especially effective on images of human faces.

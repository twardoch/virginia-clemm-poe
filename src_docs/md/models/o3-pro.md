## Bot Information

**Creator:** @openai

**Description:** o3-pro is a well-rounded and powerful model across domains, with more capability than https://poe.com/o3 at the cost of higher price and lower speed. It is especially capable at math, science, coding, visual reasoning tasks, technical writing, and instruction-following. Use it to think through multi-step problems that involve analysis across text, code, and images. 

To instruct the bot to use more reasoning effort, add --reasoning_effort to the end of your message with one of "low", "medium", or "high".

**Extra:** Powered by OpenAI: o3-pro-2025-06-10. Learn more
